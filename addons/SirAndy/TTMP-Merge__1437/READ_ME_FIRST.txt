Want to help improve TTMP?
Upload your asset files to the url above and they will be merged into the next release!


=========================================
IMPORTANT - ACHTUNG - ATTENTION - WICHTIG
=========================================
If you already have TTMP installed, do *NOT* simply overwrite your "SavedVariables" file with a newer version!
DON'T DO IT! There really is no reason to ever replace the "SavedVariables/TamrielMapping.lua" file directly.
You will lose everything you have ever mapped yourself!

Only touch the "SavedVariables/TamrielMapping.lua" file if:

- This is your first install of TTMP and you want to start with my asset file instead of creating your own (empty) file.
    See "Using my latest Asset file" for instructions on how to use my latest "SavedVariables" file, which already has over 63,000 tracked assets.

- You already have TTMP and you want to merge my latest asset file with yours. If so, follow the TTMPMerge instructions!

Installation/Update:
=========================================
Simply unzip the download and copy the 'TamrielMapping' folder into your ESO "AddOns" folder and restart ESO.
If you're updating to a newer version, simply replace the whole folder.

=========================================
Using my latest Asset file:
=========================================
If you don't want to start fresh, you can use my latest "SavedVariables" file, which already has over 63,000 tracked assets.
Simply copy my "SavedVariables/TamrielMapping.lua" into your ESO "SavedVariables" folder.

=========================================
Updating your Asset file:
=========================================
If you have already used TTMP, you can use my "SavedVariables/TamrielMapping.lua" file and the TTMPMerge AddOn to merge my asset file with your existing one.
In fact, you can merge files from any other TTMP user as well.

USAGE:
To use TTMPMerge you need to:

- Get my (or someone else's) "SavedVariables/TamrielMapping.lua" file
- Rename it to "TTMPMerge.lua"
- Copy it into your "SavedVariables" folder
- Open it with a text editor (make sure your text editor supports utf8!) and replace "TamrielMapping_Vars" in the first line with "TTMPMerge_Vars".
- Start ESO, enable TTMPMerge, load into a character and use the /ttmp merge command.

You can run a "test" by using "/ttmp merge test" which will process the new file but not make any changes to your local TTMP file.

NOTE:
Running a merge will freeze the game for several seconds, depending on how large the file is you're trying to import. This is OK!
It shouldn't take any longer than 5 - 10 seconds.

As always, please make sure you have a backup of your existing "SavedVariables" files before doing a merge!


=========================================
TTMP Usage:
=========================================
/ttmp cmd (comment)

TTMP Commands to add Assets:
ore wood cloth water rune reagent plant chest
backpack pack sack crate map fish fissure
shard book quest survey poi(nt) trove box clam site

Commands can be followed by an optional comment, for example 'shard 6' or 'book Manual of Spellcraft'.

Other TTMP Commands:

save -> Saves all your newly found Assets to disk. Note that this will also reload the UI.
By default newly found Assets are only saved to disk when you logout to the character select screen!

del xxx -> Deletes Asset xxx at your current position where xxx is the type. For example 'del backpack'

pos -> Lists your current position on the map.

list (all) -> List a count of all Assets in the current zone.
If you specify 'all', Assets are counted for all zones!

merge (test) (all) -> Merge new Assets from a merge file.
By default only Assets that don't already exist in your local file are imported.
If you specify 'test', info about the merger is displayed but nothing as actually imported.
If you specify 'all', everything is imported and your existing Assets may be overwritten!
Note: This requires the TTMPMerge AddOn to be installed.

importhm (test) -> Experimental  HarvestMap importer.
This will try to import assets from your HarvestMap AddOn install.
If you specify 'test', info about the merger is displayed but nothing is actually imported.

TTMP Configuration:
/ttmpcfg -> Shows the TTMP Config menu.

NOTE:
By default certain nodes are *NOT* shown on your map!
Please go to your Map Filters (the funnel looking icon between the key and the pin) and select what icons you want to see on the map!
